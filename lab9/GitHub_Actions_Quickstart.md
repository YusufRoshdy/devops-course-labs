# GitHub Actions Quickstart Guide

## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

### Reading the Official Guide

#### Steps Followed:

1. Created a `.github/workflows` directory in the repository.
2. Inside that directory, created a `github-actions-demo.yml` file.
3. Added the necessary configuration to the YAML file as per the quickstart guide.
4. Committed the workflow file to the branch, which triggered the GitHub Actions workflow.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Workflow**: A configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs. Defined using YAML.
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner.
- **Step**: An individual task that can run commands in a job.
- **Runner**: A server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed.
- **Event**: A specific activity that triggers a workflow.
- **Artifact**: Files created during the build process, which can be used later on.
- **Workflow Dispatch**: An event that allows workflows to be manually triggered.

### Observing the Workflow Execution

#### Execution Details:

- Pushed changes to the repository triggered the workflow automatically.
- Workflow checked out the code and ran the configured steps.
- No errors were encountered during the execution.
