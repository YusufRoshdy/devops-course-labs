# Version Control Systems

## Definition and Purpose

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help multiple people work on the same project without interfering with each other's work. They keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database, allowing developers to revert back to a previous state, compare changes, and work on parallel lines of development.

## Benefits and Advantages in a Collaborative Environment

- **Track Changes**: Easily see what changes were made, by whom, and when.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Backup**: Every change is stored, so it acts as a backup.
- **Revert**: Can revert to a previous state if a bug is discovered.
- **Blame**: Determine who introduced an issue and when.
  
## Types of Version Control Systems

- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**:
  - All changes and versions are stored on a single server.
  - Examples: Subversion (SVN), Perforce.
- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**:
  - Every user has a full copy of the repository, allowing them to work offline.
  - Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar.

## Comparison of Popular Version Control Systems

- **Git**:
  - Distributed VCS.
  - Fast and efficient.
  - Has a steep learning curve.
  - Most popular, especially for open-source projects.
- **Subversion (SVN)**:
  - Centralized VCS.
  - Directories are versioned.
  - Atomic commits.
- **Mercurial**:
  - Distributed VCS.
  - Easier learning curve than Git.
  - Well-suited for larger projects.
