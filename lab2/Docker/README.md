# Docker

## Description

Docker is a powerful platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## Purpose and Benefits in DevOps

Docker simplifies the development lifecycle by eliminating the 'it works on my machine' problem. It enables collaboration by making it easy to share containers or container images between developers and operational teams.

## Key Features and Functionalities

- Containerization of applications for isolation and security.
- Docker Hub for sharing and accessing container images.
- Easy to use CLI and API.
- Integration with popular CI/CD tools.
- Volume mounting for data persistence

## Use Cases and Examples

Companies like Spotify, Yelp, and Expedia use Docker to containerize their applications, enabling them to build once and run anywhere, be it developers' local machines or production servers.
